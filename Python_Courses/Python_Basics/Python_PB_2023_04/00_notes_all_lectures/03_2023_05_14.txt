1. make correct solution; problem must be solved correctly;
2. optimizations/refactoring;


[Pseudocode]
nested structures;
nested if-statements;

if condition1:
    line_1
	if condition2:
	   line_2
	   ...
	   

if number > 100:

if number >= 100 and number < 200:  # number is between [100; 200)
   True and True => True

Boolean operators:
and, or, not

() => priority

# or => searching for 1st True value
# and => 1st False value -> return False


================
in SD copy + paste is a bad practice
DRY principle == Do Not Repeat Yourself
